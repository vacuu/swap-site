## A Juggling Application
Build with client side js. 
You can easily manipulate a site-swap pattern (e.g. 645) by chaning
two throws. In order to keep a valid pattern
the landing beats have to be provided. To do so the first throw will land where the second throw should be landed. And vis versa: The second throw has to land on the first throw landing beat.

The php code is added to be able to host it on heroku:
https://beatree127-swap-site.herokuapp.com/

## What can you do?
As a juggler there is a notation for juggling patterns which is called site-swap notation.
With this you can learn new patterns and explore the juggling universe.
To explore the universe even wider I created this app to manipulate
patterns.

## Example
Image you like to juggle 66661 but you don't want to do the 1.
You can now decide to manipulate it with maybe the last 6.
Now the outcum is still a valid juggling pattern: 66625.
